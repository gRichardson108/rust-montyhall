# rust-montyhall
A rustlang implementation of a simulation of the (Monty Hall problem)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Simple_solutions].

This is a simple program that runs a fixed number of trials of the Monty Hall problem, with a "Swapping" player, who changes their choice when given the opportunity, and a "Non-Swapping" player, who does not.
